### Hello!

::: justify
My name is Lea Pradella, I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher]{style="color:black;"} at the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.au.dk/en/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), Denmark.

[I study how people talk to one another about politics in democratic societies, both online and offline.]{style="color:black;"} My research examines the psychological and communicative processes that shape how citizens perceive, interpret, and respond to one another during political discussions. In particular, I investigate the conditions under which these interactions become hostile and polarized, as well as the factors that make constructive and cooperative dialogue possible. 

[My PhD Dissertation]{style="color:black;"} "[Understanding the Other Side: Empathy Across The Political Divide](https://politica.dk/fileadmin/politica/Dokumenter/Afhandlinger/lea_pradella.pdf)" investigated the causes and consequences of empathy in interactions between political opponents. It was awarded the [[Best Dissertation Prize]{style="color:black;"}](https://international.au.dk/about/profile/honorary-awards-and-grants/aarhus-university-research-foundation-phd-prizes) from the Aarhus University Research Foundation in 2025.

In my research, I use [quantitative methods]{style="color:black;"}, specializing in surveys and survey experiments. Additionally, I am currently expanding my skills in quantitative text analysis and exploring quasi-experimental designs and field experiments to study political interactions in real-world settings.

[I am currently involved in two major research projects:]{style="color:black;"}

::::: {style="font-size: 95%;"}
1.  [Research on Online Political Hostility (ROPH) Project](https://ps.au.dk/forskning/forskningsprojekter/research-on-online-political-hostility), where we investigate causes, consequences and counter-strategies of online political hostility.
2.  [Partisan Peer Pressure and Affective Polarization (PEERPOL) Project](https://ps.au.dk/en/current/allnews/news/artikel/dff-bevilling-paa-62-millioner-kroner-til-troels-boeggild), where we investigate how peer-to-peer conversations shape political and affective polarization.
