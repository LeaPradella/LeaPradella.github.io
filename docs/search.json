    "text": "Welcome!\nI am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark. I have recently submitted my PhD thesis “Understanding the Other Side: Empathy Across The Political Divide” in which I investigate the causes and consequences of empathy in interactions between political opponents.\nMy research sits at the intersection of political science, psychology, and communication. I am fascinated by the processes underlying political interactions among citizens. Why, how, and when do these interactions occur? How do they unfold, and what factors contribute to constructive or hostile exchanges? What are the consequences of these interactions for society and democracy?\nI am also a Research Assistant working on the Research on Online Political Hostility (ROPH) Project, where I examine how social media platform designs influence political interactions among citizens, with a particular focus on the dynamics of face-to-face versus chat-based interactions. Additionally, I am part of the Partisan Peer Pressure and Affective Polarization (PEERPOL) Project where I investigate how peer-to-peer conversations shape political and affective polarization.\nIn my research, I use quantitative methods, specializing in surveys and survey experiments. On top, I am currently developing skills in quantitative text analysis and exploring the potential of using quasi-experimental designs to investigate political interactions in real-world contexts.\n\n\n\n Interests\n\nPolitical Psychology\nPolitical Behavior\nPolitical Communication\nEmpathy\nInter-group Relations\nSocial Media Behavior\nExperimental Methods\nCausal Inference\n\n\n\n Education\n\nMSc Political Science\nAarhus University, Denmark\nBA Political Science, Minor in Psychology\nUniversity of Mannheim, Germany\n\n\n\n\nLatest update: October 2024"
