What are the consequences of these interactions for society and democracy?\nAs a postdoctoral researcher, I am currently involved in two major research projects at Aarhus University:\n\nResearch on Online Political Hostility (ROPH) Project - here, we investigate how social media platform designs influence political interactions among citizens, with a particular focus on the dynamics of face-to-face versus chat-based interactions.\nPartisan Peer Pressure and Affective Polarization (PEERPOL) Project - here, we investigate how peer-to-peer conversations shape political and affective polarization.\n\nMy PhD Dissertation “Understanding the Other Side: Empathy Across The Political Divide”, laid the foundation for my research agenda and explores the causes and consequences of empathy in interactions between political opponents.\nIn my research, I use quantitative methods, specializing in surveys and survey experiments.
