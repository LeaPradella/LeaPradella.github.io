What keeps people from accurately understanding their adversaries? How can we promote more accurate understanding? Does this reduce hostility? And when does understanding become a source of dilemma and potentially counterproductive in democratic societies? To investigate this, I mostly employ survey experiments.\n\n\n\n Interests\n\nPolitical Psychology\nPolitical Behavior\nPolitical Communication\nEmpathy\nIntergroup Relations\nSocial Media Behavior\nCausal Inference\nExperimental Methods\n\n\n\n Education\n\nMSc Political Science\nAarhus University, Denmark\nBA Political Science, Minor in Psychology\nUniversity of Mannheim, Germany"
